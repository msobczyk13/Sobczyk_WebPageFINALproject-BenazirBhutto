 <!--Biography of Benazir Bhutto-->
    	    <h1>Biography</h1> <br />
<!--Biography Paragraph 1-->
    	    <p> Benazir Bhutto was the first women elected to lead
    	    a Muslim state. She served as
    	    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/benazir-bhutto">
    	    Prime Minister </a> of Pakistan. Benazir was the
    	    daughter of a former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. 
    	    Her family came from the Bhutto tribe of Sindhi and she
    	    was born in Karachi, Sindh. During her early life, she 
			spoke both Urdu and English.</p> 
    	    
<!--Biography Paragraph 2--> 
    	    <p>Her parents were opponents of the military dictatorship
    	    run by General Zia-ul-Ha and in the summer of 1979 they
    	    were placed under house arrest where they faced great 
    	    difficulties. She was released from house arrest in 1984
    	    which is when she began campaigning for a restoration of
    	    democracy. She made a speach at the European Parliament 
    	    in Strasbourg warning of human rights abuses in Pakistan,
    	    shortly after her brother was murdered. Bhutto and her 
    	    party won the largest percentage of seats and were able
    	    to form a coalition government.</p>

<!--Biography Paragraph 3-->
    	    <p>She was sworn in as Prime Minister for the first time in
    	    1988 at the age of 35. She was removed from office 20 months
    	    later for alleged corruption. She was referred to as "Iron Lady"
    	    for her uncompromising approach to negotiating with unions when
    	    she was prime minister. She pursued various free market economic
    	    policies, such as deregulation, flexible labour markets and 
    	    privatisation. However, rising unemployment and inflation made 
    	    her economic policies unpopular. She was 
    	    <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22394552"> 
    	    assassinated </a> on December 27, 2007 when she was campaigning 
    	    for the PPF. Later she was named one of seven winners of the United
    	    Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights.</p>
